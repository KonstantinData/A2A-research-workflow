"""Consolidate results produced by individual research agents.

The real project would merge a complex nested structure following the
``company.core.schema.json`` definition.  For the purposes of this exercise we
only need a lightâ€‘weight merger that records which agent supplied which piece of
information and when it was collected.  Each agent is expected to return a
dictionary where top level keys are field names and the special key ``source``
identifies the agent.

Example input::

    [
        {"source": "agent1", "legal_name": "Acme GmbH"},
        {"source": "agent2", "employees": 120},
    ]

Output::

    {
        "legal_name": {"value": "Acme GmbH", "source": "agent1",
                       "last_verified_at": "..."},
        "employees": {"value": 120, "source": "agent2",
                       "last_verified_at": "..."},
    }
