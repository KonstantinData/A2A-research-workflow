# Diagnostics Report

This document captures each notable finding identified during the initial analysis of the repository’s source code and configuration.  Each row is assigned a unique `diagnostics_id` and will be linked to a backlog item in the modernization plan.  Findings are based solely on the actual code and configuration files—not on any README or marketing materials.

| diagnostics_id | category | description | evidence | severity | fix_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FND-001` | **Outdated dependencies** | The project uses `pptxgenjs` version 4.0.0, while version 4.0.1 (released on 26 June 2025) is available.  The release notes indicate bug fixes and an update to `image-size` 1.2.1【456086497610870†L229-L241】.  Staying on older versions may expose the project to bugs and security issues. | Release notes for v4.0.1 show fixes and updates【456086497610870†L229-L241】. | High | PLAN-001 |
| `FND-002` | **Outdated dependencies** | The `tailwindcss` dependency is pinned at `4.1.10` while the latest patch release (v4.1.13 as of 4 September 2025) includes multiple fixes—such as dropping warnings from the browser build and discarding invalid variants【110831682360645†L223-L247】.  Updating to the latest minor version reduces bug surface and improves DX. | Tailwind CSS release notes list changes and fixes in v4.1.13【110831682360645†L223-L247】. | Medium | PLAN-001 |
| `FND-003` | **Missing CI/CD and security automation** | The repository has no CI workflows to install dependencies, run tests or lint, build the slides, or verify Python utilities.  Additionally, there is no Dependabot or CodeQL setup to automatically detect vulnerable dependencies.  GitHub Docs state that enabling Dependabot security updates will automatically raise pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies【560759686713697†L542-L556】. | Absence of `.github/workflows` directory; GitHub documentation on Dependabot automating updates【560759686713697†L542-L556】. | High | PLAN-002 |
| `FND-004` | **Lack of testing** | There are no unit or integration tests for either the JavaScript slide generator or the Python scripts.  Without automated tests, future refactoring and upgrades risk breaking functionality unnoticed.  GitHub’s Dependabot guidance emphasises the importance of having automated tests before merging updates【560759686713697†L572-L578】. | Absence of any `tests/` directory or testing configuration; Dependabot docs mention the importance of automated tests【560759686713697†L572-L578】. | High | PLAN-003 |
| `FND-005` | **No linting or formatting standards** | There is no ESLint or Prettier configuration.  Consistent code style improves maintainability and reduces bugs. | Lack of `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, or similar configuration files in the repository. | Medium | PLAN-004 |
| `FND-006` | **No TypeScript types** | Although `typescript` is present in `package.json`, the JavaScript files use plain CommonJS syntax and do not leverage TypeScript’s static type checking.  Migrating to TypeScript would improve reliability and developer experience. | JavaScript files (`answer.js`, `slides_template.js`) use CommonJS and lack type annotations. | Low | PLAN-005 |
| `FND-007` | **Python script invocation of external binary** | The `pptx_to_img.py` script invokes `soffice` (LibreOffice) via `subprocess.run` without verifying its presence or handling errors.  This external dependency may not be available on all systems and can lead to runtime failures.  The script also performs filesystem operations without input validation. | In `pptx_to_img.py`, `subprocess.run` calls `soffice` to convert PPTX to PDF, and file paths are taken directly from user arguments. | Medium | PLAN-006 |
| `FND-008` | **No containerization or reproducible environment** | The project lacks a `Dockerfile` or similar container specification, making it harder to ensure reproducible builds and deployments.  Containerizing the application would simplify environment setup and integration with CI/CD pipelines. | Absence of Dockerfile or container specification in the repository. | Low | PLAN-007 |
| `FND-009` | **No observability or logging** | The scripts do not implement structured logging or error reporting.  Adding logging would aid troubleshooting and operational monitoring. | The JavaScript and Python files only print minimal output and do not use a logging framework. | Low | PLAN-008 |
| `FND-010` | **Missing documentation on architecture and usage** | There is no technical documentation explaining how the slide generator and utility scripts work together.  Creating clear internal documentation would facilitate onboarding and maintenance. | No `docs/` or `architecture` documents exist in the repository. | Low | PLAN-009 |

**Legend:**  
*Severity levels* – **High** indicates an issue that could significantly impact security, stability, or maintainability; **Medium** warrants attention but may not be immediately exploitable; **Low** items are improvements or best practices.

The `fix_id` column will link each finding to a specific backlog item once the modernization plan is created.
