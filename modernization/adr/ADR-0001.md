# ADR‑0001: Upgrade pptxgenjs, image‑size and tailwindcss to latest patch versions

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The initial diagnostics highlighted outdated dependencies: `pptxgenjs` pinned at **4.0.0**, `image-size` at **2.0.2**, and `tailwindcss` at **4.1.10**.  Upstream release notes show that `pptxgenjs` **v4.0.1** (26 June 2025) introduces important bug fixes and upgrades its internal `image-size` dependency to **1.2.1**【456086497610870†L229-L241】.  Meanwhile, `tailwindcss` **v4.1.13** (4 September 2025) addresses numerous CSS emission and variant‑handling bugs【110831682360645†L223-L247】.  Leaving these libraries outdated risks encountering fixed defects and potential security issues.

## Decision

Upgrade the following dependencies to their latest patch versions:

* `pptxgenjs` → **4.0.1** (released 26 June 2025)【456086497610870†L229-L241】.
* `image-size` → **1.2.1** (bundled upgrade noted in pptxgenjs release)【456086497610870†L229-L241】.
* `tailwindcss` → **4.1.13** (released 4 September 2025)【110831682360645†L223-L247】.

These updates are patch‑level and unlikely to introduce breaking API changes.  They resolve known bugs (e.g., hyperlink repair, border type handling in pptxgenjs, and CSS emission issues in tailwindcss) and improve stability and compatibility.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

* Leverages bug fixes and minor improvements documented in upstream release notes【456086497610870†L229-L241】【110831682360645†L223-L247】.
* Aligns the project with the latest supported patch versions, facilitating future updates.
* Reduces risk of latent vulnerabilities or defects present in older versions.

**Negative:**

* Requires regenerating `package-lock.json` via `npm install`, which may change other transitive dependencies.
* Slight risk of unforeseen regressions; mitigated by adding automated tests (planned separately).

## Rollback Plan

If the update introduces unexpected regressions, revert the changes by restoring the previous versions in `package.json` (`pptxgenjs@4.0.0`, `image-size@2.0.2`, `tailwindcss@4.1.10`) and reinstalling dependencies.  Retain the previous `package-lock.json` for deterministic builds.
