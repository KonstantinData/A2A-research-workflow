# ADR‑0002: Introduce CI/CD pipeline with Dependabot and CodeQL

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The project currently has no automated build or test pipeline.  All dependency management and security scanning are manual.  Research shows that enabling Dependabot security updates on a repository with GitHub Actions will automatically raise pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies【560759686713697†L542-L556】.  The same documentation emphasises that automated tests should be in place to safely merge these updates【560759686713697†L572-L578】.  A CI pipeline is therefore necessary to build, lint and test the project on each change and to integrate with Dependabot and CodeQL scanning.

## Decision

Implement a GitHub Actions workflow that will run on pull requests and pushes to `main`.  The workflow will:

* Install Node and Python dependencies.
* Run JavaScript linting and tests (once added).
* Run Python tests (once added) using `pytest`.
* Build the slides using the generation script.
* Upload artifacts (e.g., generated PPTX) for inspection.

In addition, commit configuration files for Dependabot to monitor the `npm` and `github-actions` ecosystems and raise pull requests for insecure dependencies.  Enable CodeQL code scanning for JavaScript and Python to detect common vulnerabilities.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

* Provides immediate feedback on broken builds and tests.
* Automates detection of vulnerable dependencies via Dependabot【560759686713697†L542-L556】.
* Adds security scanning, improving code quality and robustness.

**Negative:**

* Increases repository complexity by adding workflow and configuration files.
* May lengthen pull request times due to CI execution.

## Rollback Plan

If the CI pipeline causes issues (e.g., long build times or false positives), the workflow can be disabled by removing the YAML files from `.github/workflows` and by disabling Dependabot and CodeQL in repository settings.
