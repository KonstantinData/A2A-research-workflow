# ADR-0009: Create project documentation

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Finding FND-010 noted that the project lacked technical documentation.  Research note FND-010 evaluated documentation options and found that well-structured project documentation, including architecture, usage, and contribution guidelines, is essential for onboarding and long-term sustainability【801642453192407†L547-L593】.

## Decision

We will create a `docs/` directory containing Markdown files such as `architecture.md` and `usage.md`.  These documents will describe the project’s architecture, data flows, installation instructions, usage patterns, and guidance for contributing.  The root README will link to these documents.

## Consequences

* Clear documentation will improve developer onboarding and knowledge transfer.
* Maintenance effort is required to keep docs up to date with code changes.

## Rollback Plan

Delete the `docs/` directory and remove any links from the README or other files.
