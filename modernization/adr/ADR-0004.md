# ADR-0004: Adopt ESLint and Prettier

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Finding FND-005 identified that the project lacks linting and formatting
standards. Research note FND-005 compared options and concluded that combining
ESLint with Prettier provides the best balance between code quality and
developer experience【670397622447218†L69-L99】【775739179743925†L114-L116】.
ESLint identifies potential bugs and enforces best practices, while Prettier
ensures consistent formatting.

## Decision

We will integrate ESLint and Prettier into the project. A `.eslintrc.json`
file will extend the recommended configuration (`@eslint/js` and
`eslint-config-prettier`), and a `.prettierrc` file will define formatting
preferences. A `lint` script will be added to `package.json`, and the CI
workflow will run lint checks.

## Consequences

* Developers must install ESLint and Prettier (as devDependencies) and may need to
  fix lint errors.
* Consistent code style will improve readability and reduce bugs.
* The CI pipeline will fail on lint errors, enforcing quality standards.

## Rollback Plan

Remove `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`, and the lint script from
`package.json`. Remove lint steps from the CI workflow.
