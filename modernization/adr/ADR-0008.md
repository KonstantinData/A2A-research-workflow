# ADR-0008: Add structured logging for Node.js and Python

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Finding FND-009 highlighted the absence of structured logging.  Research note FND-009 compared available logging libraries and recommended using the `pino` package for Node.js and Python’s built-in `logging` module【896342947433198†L8-L9】【892386362832287†L78-L83】.

## Decision

We will install the `pino` library and integrate it into `answer.js` for JSON-formatted logging with adjustable log levels.  Python scripts will configure the standard `logging` module with a consistent format and use it instead of `print` statements.

## Consequences

* Logging calls will provide structured output, aiding troubleshooting and observability.
* Additional dependencies (pino) are introduced.
* Developers must use the logging API instead of printing directly.

## Rollback Plan

Remove `pino` from `package.json` and revert logging calls to simple `console.log` or `print` statements in JavaScript and Python files.
