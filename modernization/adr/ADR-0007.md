# ADR-0007: Provide a Dockerfile for reproducible builds

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Finding FND-008 states that the project lacks a container specification.
Research note FND-008 notes that Docker containers package the application and
its dependencies into a standardised environment so it runs consistently
across different hosts【279145847034687†L149-L161】. A container image can include
Node.js, Python, and LibreOffice.

## Decision

We will add a `Dockerfile` to build the application in a reproducible
environment. The Dockerfile will use a multi‑stage build: the first stage
installs build dependencies (Node.js packages, Python packages, LibreOffice)
and runs tests; the second stage copies only the necessary artifacts. A
`.dockerignore` will exclude local caches. The CI workflow will build and
optionally publish this image.

## Consequences

* Contributors can run the project without installing dependencies locally.
* The image increases repository size slightly and requires Docker to be
  installed.
* Build times may increase due to the multi‑stage build.

## Rollback Plan

Remove the `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, and related CI steps.
