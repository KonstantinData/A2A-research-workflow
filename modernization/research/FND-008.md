# FND-008 – Research: Containerization

## Problem capsule

The repository does not provide a container specification. Without a container,
contributors must manually install Node.js, Python, and LibreOffice, which can
lead to inconsistent environments and build failures.

## Goals / NFRs

* Package the application and its dependencies in a reproducible environment.
* Support both Node.js and Python dependencies.
* Include LibreOffice for image conversion.
* Keep the image lightweight and secure.

## Options comparison

| Option | Version / Recency | Pros | Cons | Risks | Migration path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dockerfile with multi‑stage build** | Docker 25.x | Docker containers separate the application from the host, packaging code and dependencies into a standardised environment so it runs consistently across different hosts【279145847034687†L149-L161】. Multi‑stage builds can reduce the final image size and keep dependencies separated. | Requires maintaining a Dockerfile; increases complexity for contributors unfamiliar with Docker. | Low. | Create a Dockerfile: base on an official Node image, install Python and LibreOffice via apt, copy code, install npm dependencies, run tests. Provide instructions in documentation. |
| **Using virtualisation (e.g., Vagrant)** | VirtualBox/Vagrant 2025 | Provides a full VM replicating the environment. | Heavyweight, slower to build and run; less integrated with CI. | Medium: bigger resource overhead. | Write Vagrantfile; use virtualisation. |
| **Using language‑specific package managers without a container** | n/a | Simpler; fewer files. | Developers may have mismatched Node/Python versions; environment drift. | High: inconsistent builds; unpredictable behaviour across machines. | Continue to rely on manual setup, updating README with installation instructions. |

## Preferred option

Create a Dockerfile with a multi‑stage build. Docker ensures that applications run
consistently across different environments by packaging the application and its
dependencies into a lightweight container【279145847034687†L149-L161】. Including
Node.js, Python, and LibreOffice in the container will enable reproducible
builds and simplify CI/CD integration.
