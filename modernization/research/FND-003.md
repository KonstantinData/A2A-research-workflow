## Research Note – FND‑003: Missing CI/CD and security automation

### Problem capsule

The current repository lacks any continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery (CD) workflows.  There are no automated builds, linting, tests or security checks when changes are pushed.  This absence increases the risk of undetected regressions and leaves dependencies outdated and potentially vulnerable.  GitHub’s documentation notes that when Dependabot security updates are enabled, it will automatically raise pull requests to update vulnerable GitHub Actions to the minimum patched versions【560759686713697†L542-L556】.  Dependabot also requires automated tests to safely merge updates【560759686713697†L572-L578】.

### Goals and non‑functional requirements

* **Early detection of defects:** Run builds and tests on every pull request and main branch commit.
* **Automated dependency management:** Integrate Dependabot to raise pull requests for vulnerable dependencies in `npm` packages and GitHub Actions.
* **Security scanning:** Incorporate code scanning (e.g., GitHub CodeQL) to detect common vulnerabilities.
* **Ease of maintenance:** Use configuration files that require minimal upkeep.

### Options comparison

| Option | Components | Pros | Cons | Risks & effort |
|------|-----------|------|------|----------------|
| **1. Manual process** | Rely on developers to run tests locally and update dependencies by hand | No setup required | Error‑prone; inconsistent testing; outdated dependencies may linger | High risk of human error; no automated alerts |
| **2. Basic CI only** | Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `npm install` and tests | Ensures code builds on PRs; catches obvious failures | Still requires manual dependency updates; no security scanning or Dependabot integration | Moderate effort; partial coverage |
| **3. Full CI with Dependabot and code scanning** (recommended) | GitHub Actions workflow runs linting, tests and builds; Dependabot configuration for `npm` and `github-actions` ecosystems; CodeQL scanning enabled for JavaScript and Python | Automated builds and tests for every change; Dependabot automatically raises PRs for vulnerable dependencies; security scanning detects code issues; integrated into the GitHub ecosystem | Requires initial setup of multiple YAML files; may need tuning for performance | Initial configuration effort; low ongoing maintenance |

### Decision guidance

Option 3 is recommended.  GitHub’s documentation highlights that enabling Dependabot on a repository with GitHub Actions will result in automatic security update pull requests【560759686713697†L542-L556】.  The same documentation stresses the importance of automated tests when merging dependency updates【560759686713697†L572-L578】—a test suite will be implemented in PLAN‑003.  Code scanning via GitHub’s CodeQL engine provides additional security coverage with minimal overhead.
