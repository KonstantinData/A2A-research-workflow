## Research Note – FND‑001: Outdated dependencies

### Problem capsule

The project currently pins `pptxgenjs` to version **4.0.0** along with related dependencies such as `tailwindcss` and `image-size`.  Staying on older versions may leave bug fixes and security updates unapplied.  Release notes for `pptxgenjs` **v4.0.1** (released 26 June 2025) mention several bug fixes and an upgrade of `image-size` to **v1.2.1**【456086497610870†L229-L241】, while `tailwindcss` patch release **v4.1.13** (4 September 2025) includes multiple fixes and improvements【110831682360645†L223-L247】.  Modernizing the project therefore requires upgrading these dependencies.

### Goals and non‑functional requirements

* **Security & stability:** Apply the latest patch releases to reduce vulnerability surface and address known bugs.
* **Minimal breaking change risk:** Prefer patch-level updates (e.g., `4.0.0 → 4.0.1`) to avoid major API changes.
* **Maintainability:** Align with upstream recommendations; avoid pinning outdated versions.

### Options comparison

| Option | Version/recency | Pros | Cons | Risks & migration effort |
|------|---------------|------|------|--------------------------|
| **1. Keep current versions** | Use `pptxgenjs@4.0.0`, `image-size@2.0.2`, `tailwindcss@4.1.10` as declared | No immediate work required; avoids potential update regressions | Leaves known bugs unfixed; `image-size` used by `pptxgenjs` has been updated to 1.2.1【456086497610870†L229-L241】; missing tailwind fixes such as CSS emission deduplication【110831682360645†L223-L247】 | Risk of latent bugs and vulnerabilities; may hinder future upgrades |
| **2. Upgrade to latest patch versions** (recommended) | `pptxgenjs@4.0.1` (26 Jun 2025), `image-size@1.2.1` (Bundled with pptxgenjs update)【456086497610870†L229-L241】, `tailwindcss@4.1.13` (4 Sep 2025)【110831682360645†L223-L247】 | Gains bug fixes such as hyperlink repair and border issues【456086497610870†L229-L241】; tailwind improvements like discarding invalid variants【110831682360645†L223-L247】; minimal API surface change; aligns with upstream support window | Requires updating `package.json` and regenerating `package-lock.json`; must run `npm install` | Low risk; patch versions should be backwards compatible; ensure tests cover basic functionality |
| **3. Migrate to next major versions** | `pptxgenjs@4.x` currently latest minor, no major bump; `tailwindcss@5.0.0` (not yet released) | Could gain significant new features; potential for improved performance | High migration effort; major versions often introduce breaking changes; no stable major versions available as of Sept 2025 | Not applicable now; reserved for future modernisation cycles |

### Decision guidance

Given the emphasis on security and stability with minimal disruption, **Option 2** is recommended: update `pptxgenjs` to **4.0.1**, `image-size` to **1.2.1**, and `tailwindcss` to **4.1.13**.  These updates apply patch‑level fixes without altering the public API and are documented in upstream release notes【456086497610870†L229-L241】【110831682360645†L223-L247】.
