# Research Note F001 — Runtime & Dependency Pinning

**Problem**: python:3.11 base, unpinned requirements → non-deterministic builds and supply-chain risk.

**Goals/NFRs**: LTS-ish runtime, deterministic builds (hash-locked), compatibility with FastAPI/Uvicorn/WeasyPrint/OpenAI SDK.

**Options**

| Option | Version | Pros | Cons | Risks | Migration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stay on Python 3.11 | 3.11 | Stable today | Aging; libs adding 3.13-only wheels | Lag on perf & security | None |
| Upgrade to Python 3.12 | 3.12 | Mature, widely supported | One more hop soon | Medium churn | Rebuild images |
| Upgrade to Python 3.13 | 3.13 | Current stable; supported by Uvicorn & WeasyPrint | Some older libs may lag | Minor build changes | Rebuild & test |
