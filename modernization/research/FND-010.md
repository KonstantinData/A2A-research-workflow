# FND-010 – Research: Technical documentation

## Problem capsule

The repository lacks technical documentation explaining the architecture, data
flows, and usage. Without clear docs, new contributors struggle to understand
the system, hindering onboarding and long‑term maintainability.

## Goals / NFRs

* Provide a high‑level overview of the architecture and components.
* Describe how to run the slide generator and utility scripts.
* Include instructions for extending slides and adding new features.
* Ensure documentation stays up to date and accessible.

## Options comparison

| Option | Version / Recency | Pros | Cons | Risks | Migration path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Write comprehensive documentation (architecture, usage, contributing)** | n/a | A well‑structured README or internal wiki with project overview, setup instructions, codebase structure, and contribution guidelines helps onboard developers and supports long‑term sustainability【801642453192407†L547-L593】. | Requires time to write and maintain; must be updated alongside code changes. | Low: outdated docs if not maintained. | Create a `docs/` directory containing Markdown documents; use diagrams where useful; link from README; integrate with CI to check for missing docs. |
| **Rely on code comments and inline documentation only** | n/a | Minimal overhead. | Insufficient context for new developers; does not cover system architecture or setup procedures. | Medium: knowledge is trapped in code; onboarding difficulty. | Maintain thorough docstrings in code. |
| **Use automated documentation generators** | Tools like JSDoc, TypeDoc, or Sphinx | Generates API docs directly from code comments. | Does not cover architecture or usage; still requires narrative docs. | Low: may require additional config. | Write doc comments; configure generator; host docs. |

## Preferred option

Create human‑written technical documentation in a `docs/` directory. A
well‑structured README or internal wiki detailing project overview, installation,
codebase layout, and contribution guidelines is essential for onboarding and
long‑term sustainability【801642453192407†L547-L593】. Automated API docs can be
generated later, but narrative documentation should be prioritised.
