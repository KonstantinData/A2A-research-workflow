# FND-009 – Research: Observability and logging

## Problem capsule

The scripts currently output minimal console messages and lack structured
logging. Without logging, diagnosing issues in production is difficult. A modern
logging solution should record structured messages with metadata and support
various log levels.

## Goals / NFRs

* Provide structured, JSON‑formatted logs for Node.js and human‑readable logs for Python.
* Enable adjustable log levels (info, debug, warn, error).
* Keep performance overhead low.
* Integrate with CI and containerization.

## Options comparison

| Option | Version / Recency | Pros | Cons | Risks | Migration path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Use `pino` for Node.js and Python’s built‑in `logging` module** | Pino 9.x; Python logging (standard library) | Pino is a very low overhead JSON logger for Node.js【896342947433198†L8-L9】 and supports transports for asynchronous log processing【896342947433198†L92-L109】. Python’s `logging` module implements a flexible event logging system that integrates messages from different modules【892386362832287†L78-L83】. Both are mature and widely used. | Adds dependencies (`pino`) and requires some configuration. | Low. | Install `pino` via npm; add a logger instance to `answer.js`; integrate with CLI outputs. For Python, import `logging`, configure basic formatting, and replace print statements with logger calls. |
| **Use `winston` for Node.js** | Winston 3.x | Winston is a popular logger with multiple transports. | Higher overhead; slower than Pino. | Low. | Replace prints with Winston; configure transports. |
| **Continue using `console.log` and prints** | n/a | No dependencies. | Unstructured logs; cannot set levels; difficult to parse. | High: poor observability and troubleshooting. | None. |

## Preferred option

Adopt `pino` in the Node.js code and Python’s built‑in `logging` module. Pino
provides a very low‑overhead JSON logger for Node.js【896342947433198†L8-L9】 and
supports asynchronous log processing【896342947433198†L92-L109】. Python’s logging
module offers a flexible event logging system that integrates logs from all
modules【892386362832287†L78-L83】. Together, these solutions provide structured
logging with minimal overhead.
