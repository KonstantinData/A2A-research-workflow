# Research Note F002 — Event-Driven Guardrails

**Problem**: Legacy agents perform side effects directly.

**Goal**: Single side-effect surface (worker). Agents emit events only.

**Options**: Hard deprecate legacy modules; or soft warn with metrics. Choose hard deprecate with CI test.

## Resolution

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

The legacy agents (`autonomous_email_agent.py`, `autonomous_report_agent.py`, `autonomous_research_agent.py`) have been replaced with deprecation shims that raise `RuntimeError` when imported. This ensures:

- No direct side effects from legacy agent code
- Clear error messages directing users to the event-driven worker
- Existing CI tests validate the deprecation behavior
- Full migration to event-driven architecture completed
