# FND-005 – Research: Linting and formatting

## Problem capsule

The project currently lacks linting and formatting configuration. Without a
consistent coding standard it becomes harder to maintain the codebase and catch
potential errors early. The goal is to introduce automated linting and
formatting to ensure code quality and developer consistency.

## Goals / NFRs

* Establish a consistent code style and formatting across JavaScript files.
* Detect and report potential bugs and problematic patterns.
* Minimise configuration complexity and integrate with CI.
* Avoid unnecessary overhead or friction in the developer workflow.

## Options comparison

| Option | Version / Recency | Pros | Cons | Risks | Migration path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ESLint with Prettier integration** | ESLint v9.x (latest as of 2025), Prettier stable | ESLint identifies patterns and enforces best practices while Prettier reprints code to ensure consistent formatting. Prettier is an opinionated formatter that removes original styling and ensures consistent output【670397622447218†L69-L99】. ESLint’s recommended configuration helps avoid bugs by checking syntax and patterns【775739179743925†L114-L116】. Integration via `eslint-config-prettier` disables conflicting rules. | Requires installing and configuring multiple packages; developers must run lint and format commands. | Low: mis‑configuration may cause CI failures until resolved. | Install ESLint and Prettier; add configuration files `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc`; integrate Prettier via ESLint plugin; add CI lint step. |
| **StandardJS or `eslint-config-standard`** | StandardJS 17.x | Single package combining linting and formatting rules, minimal configuration. | Less flexible; opinionated rules might conflict with project preferences; still need Prettier for formatting. | Low. | Install `eslint-config-standard`, extend in ESLint config; run via npm script. |
| **Prettier only** | Prettier stable | Simple to configure; formats code consistently【670397622447218†L69-L99】. | Does not detect logic errors or code smells; limited to formatting. | Medium: may allow bugs to pass unnoticed. | Install Prettier and configure with `.prettierrc`; run before committing. |

## Preferred option

Use ESLint with Prettier integration. ESLint’s recommended rules catch syntax
issues and enforce best practices【775739179743925†L114-L116】, while Prettier ensures
that code formatting is consistent and opinionated【670397622447218†L69-L99】. The
combination provides robust code quality without conflicting rules.
