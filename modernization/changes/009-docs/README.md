# Changeset 009 – Documentation

This changeset adds project documentation under the `docs/` directory.

It introduces two markdown files:

* `docs/architecture.md` outlines the high‑level architecture of the slide generation toolchain, describing the Node.js presentation generator and Python utilities, and explaining data flows.
* `docs/usage.md` provides step‑by‑step instructions for running the generator, converting presentations to images, creating montages, and extending the system.

Rollback: Remove the `docs/` directory or individual files as needed.
