"""External levelÂ 1 company search.

This agent proposes companies operating in a similar space to the
organisation named in the trigger.  It uses the static mapping
defined in :mod:`agents.company_data` to look up neighbour companies
and returns a list of suggestions.  The purpose of this step is to
provide additional research targets for further enrichment and to
avoid redundant work.  A JSON artefact is written into the
``artifacts/`` directory so subsequent steps (or external tools) may
reuse the neighbour list.
