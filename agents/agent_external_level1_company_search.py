"""External levelÂ 1 company search.

This agent proposes companies operating in a similar space to the
organisation named in the trigger.  It uses the static mapping
defined in :mod:`agents.company_data` to look up neighbour companies
and returns a list of suggestions.  The purpose of this step is to
provide additional research targets for further enrichment and to
avoid redundant work.

In the refactored data model the returned neighbour entries surface
``industry_group``, ``industry`` and ``description``.  A
``classification`` mapping is included only when available for
backwards compatibility.  A JSON artefact is written into the
``artifacts/`` directory so subsequent steps (or external tools) may
reuse the neighbour list.
