"""Internal levelÂ 2 company/customer research.

This agent proposes potential internal customers or related organisations
within the company's own ecosystem.  For the scope of this project it
reuses the static mapping from :mod:`agents.company_data`.  In a real
deployment this function would connect to a CRM or internal data
warehouse to identify opportunities based on invoices, open deals or
support tickets.
